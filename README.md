# Flappy-Bird
This game was developed in MIPS assembly by 2 computer science students(me and my team partner) of the University of Toronto of as a part of CSC58 Computer Organization course. 

Due to lack of physical MIPS processor, testing of the implementation was done in a simulated environment within MARS, i.e., a simulated bitmap display and a simulated keyboard input. 


TO PLAY FLAPPY-BIRD:

1) download the simulater from http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/

2) Donwnload the file flappybird.s from this repository and run it on MIPS. 

Feel fre to raise a suggestion or provide any feedback!
